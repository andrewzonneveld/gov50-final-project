## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to two main areas from which I will choose one. The first is the funding levels of public education in North Carolina including teaching salaries, bonuses for advanced degrees, supplemental funding from counties, etc., and how it compares to that of private schools. I'm interested in this area because North Carolina has granted millions of dollars of private school vouchers and funding while simultaneously decrease funding for public education. NC is known throughout the US for having one of the lowest levels of teacher pay compared to other states.

The second area of data I would like to explore centers around lawmakers and their relatives, specifically how their net worth, real estate, assets, investments, compensation, etc., have evolved over the years. I would like to do a comparative analysis of some of the longest serving members of Congress, proportional across parties and chambers.

## Final Proposal 

Does more funding for public education increase student achievement? In this study I hope to explore the impact of NC K-12 public school funding on student achievement. I hypothesize that as more money is dedicated to the NC Department of Public Instruction for use in K-12 schools and paying faculty salaries, student achievement will increase. Student achievement is the dependent variable and is measured in two ways. The first method of measuring student achievement is through analyzing the graduation rate of high school students in North Carolina. The second method of measuring student achievement is through analyzing the percentage of students in grades 3-8 who met the proficiency standards for reading and mathematics as defined by the NC Department of Public Instruction. These two methods of measuring student achievement will independently be compared the percent of the overall NC state budget that was set aside for public education, which is the explanatory variable. The reason for comparing achievement to the percent of the state budget designated for K-12 education rather than the actual budget itself is because overtime states will always increase the budget of public K-12 education as their populations grow and more students are expected to enroll. The percent set aside for K-12 schools, however, changes each year as state legislatures decide how much of a priority funding public education is. As the study is conducted, if student achievement grows with higher percentages of funding, my hypothesis will be true. If student achievement grows or is stagnant regardless of an increase in the percentage of funding, then my hypothesis will be false. When I run the regression of student achievement on the budget, a positive coefficient would prove support for the hypothesis.
